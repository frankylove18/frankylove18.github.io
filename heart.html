            The heart is situated almost in the middle line in the thoracic cavity
            between the lungs.
            Its lower conical part is tilted towards the left.
            Heart is enclosed in the bony thoracic cage formed by backbone, ribs, 
            breast bones and diaphragm.
          </pre>

        <h3> SHAPE AND SIZE</h3>
        <p>
            <pre>
            The heart is hollow, muscular and cone-shaped organ.
            It is about the size of a fist and weighs about 300gm in a man, and 250g in a woman.
            It meaures up to 12cm in length and 9cm in width.
            </pre>

        <h3> PERICARDIAM</h3>
        <p>
            <pre>
                The heart is enclosed ina membrane called <i class="a"><u> pericadium</u></i>
                They are formed up of two layers : <i class="a"><u> Fibrous Pericardium </u></i> and <i class="a"><u> Serous Pericardium </u></i>
                
                <div class="h">1. Fibrous Pericardium :</div> It is tough , loosely fitted and inelastic sac around the heart.
                                         It is made up of white fibrous tissue.
                                         It prevents from excessive expansion of heart.
                
                <div class="h">2. Serous Pericardium  :</div> It is formed of two thin layers.
                    (i)  Parietal Layer which forms the lining of the fibrous pericadium.
                    (ii) Visceral Layer(epicardium) forms the outer layer of heart.
                
                There is a pericadial space between the parietal and visceral layers which 
                is filled with pericardial fluid.

            The human heart is four chambered.
            It consits of two auricles and two venticles.

            <div class="h">Auricles :</div> These form small upper part of the heart.
                       Externally, these are demarcated from the venticles by <i class="a"><u>coronary sulcus</u></i>.
            
            <div class="h">Ventricles :</div> These form the largest part lower part of the heart.
                         Externally, two ventricles are markes by an obliques <i class="a"><u>interventricular sulcus</u></i>.
                         
            There are three types of Sulci(grooves) :
            1. <i class="a">Coronary sulcus</i>: It is an irregular transverse groove divides heart into anterior auricular part 
             and posterior ventricular part.
            2. Internal groove divides atrium into right and left atria.
            3. <i class="a">Interventricular Sulcus</i>: It is an oblique longitudinal groove on the ventral side
             of ventricular part.

            <h3> AURICLES </h3>

            Thin walled chambers separated by a thin interventricular(interatrial) septum.
            Lying in the septum is an oval depression, the <i class="a"> fossa ovalis </i>.

            <div class="h">1. Right Atrium :</div> 
                    
                  It is thin walled chamber and is lager than the left atrium.
                  A muscular pouch like <i class="a">auricular appendage</i>. It recieves openings of superior vena cava,
                  inferior vena cava and coronary sinus.
                  Right atrium opens into right venticle by right atrioventricular aperture.

            <div class="h">2. Left Atrium :</div>
               
                It is smaller than right atrium and has thicker walls.
                The pouch-like extension frtom its lower edge is called <i class="a">auricular appendage</i>.
                It has opening of four pulmonary veins.
                Left atrium opens into left ventricle by left atrioventricular aperture.

         <h3> VENTRICLES </h3>

          These are thick walled lower chambers of heart.
          It is separated from each other by an obliquely placed interventricular septum.

               (i) The right venticle pumps deoxygenated blood to pulmonary
               arteries which supply blood to the lungs.
               (ii) The left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood to aorta which supplies
               blood to all over the body.
         
         The right atrium and left atrium is gaurded by two valves namely :

                             the upper region of the body.
                             ii. The inferior vena cava brings deoxygenated blood from

        <h3> CARDIAC CYCLE </h3>
        <p>
            <pre>
            The sequence of completion of one heartbeat is called cardiac cycle.
            During, the cycle, the following events occurs:
            1. Jiont diastole
            2. Auricular systole
            3. Auricular diastole
            4. Ventricular systole
            5. Ventricular diastole

            <div class="h">1.Joint Diastole :</div> During this phase,blood continues to flow into the auricles filing blood in pulmonary veins and atria.
                It is about 0.4s duration. Nest heartbeat starts with the auricular systole.
            
            <div class="h">2.Auricular Systole :</div> When full of blood, the auricles pumps the blood to their respective
                venticleswhich are still in diastole.
                It is about 0.1-.015s duration.
                
                (i) During atrial systole, the bicuspid and tricuspid valves open for the flow of blood to the 
                    respective ventricles.
                (ii) Blood does not flows back as the roots are compressed for backward flow.
               
            <div class="h">3. Auricular Diastole :</div> At the end od systole, the auricles(atria) return to diastole and starts
                                    relaxing.
                                    
            <div class="h">4. Ventricular Systole :</div> With the onset of atrial diastole, the ventricles starts to contract.
                     At this time the blood gushes in, and the tricuspid and bicuspid valve closes sharply giving a <i class="a">"LUBB"</i>
                     sound.
                     The semilunar valves of the great aorta and pulmonary artery opens, then blood is pumped into the great arteries.
                     It is about 0.3s duration.
                     
            <div class="h">5. Ventricular Diastole :</div> At the end of ventricular systole, ventricles starts to contract.
                  At this time, the semilunar valves closes sharply to prevent the back flow of blood and thus causes
                  the <i class="a">"DUBB"</i> sound.
                  
          <div class="h">Joint Diastole = 0.4s |  Atrial Systole = 0.1s |  Ventricular Systole = 0.3s</div>

                Beating of heart is felt in the arteries asd regular jerks or throbs.
                Each ventricular systole starts a new pulse.
                The pulse rate is same as that of heart rate.

             In this case the blood pressure remains above 140/90mm Hg.
             It is seen in more than 10 per cent of middle aged persons.
             Persistent anxiety, excitement, anger or any other emotional stress leads to hypertension.
             Arterioscleroisis and Atheroma are two diseases responsible for hypertension.
             
             <b>Effects Of Hypertension:</b>
                     High blood pressureis a silent killer.
                     It damages arteries and their capillaries.
                     In kidney, this causes:
                                            (i)   Chronic nephritis.
                                            (ii)  In eyes, it leads to blindness.

            It is a sharp pain in the heart and chest that radiates into the left arm.
            The pain is usually in the centre of the chest and is accompanied by a feeling of suffocation,
            dizziness, and palpitation.

            Due to narrowing or blocked coronary arteries, the cardiac muscles do not get enough oxygen.
            Deprived of sufficient oxygen leads to constricting of muscles.
            The angina pain initially passes but is a warning of heart attack.

                          It is more frequent to those roughened surfaces formed due to
                          breakdown of artheroma.

                          In total blockage of a branch of coronary artery,the part of
